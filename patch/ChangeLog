Half-Life Dedicated Server
Update Readme
7/30/03

v3.1.1.1d
----------
Bug Fixes:
----------
- Fixed format string crash bug in logging 
- Added bot count to "details" server query reply
- Flipped anti-DoS logic to check per user and then global rate limits. 
Changed it so users exceeding personal rates don't add into the global 
rate calculations.
- Fixed infinite loop due to malformed infostring
- Performed optimizations on engine to improve performance

HLTV:
- Fixed missing end in HLTV demos
- Fixed missing director commands with "playdemo" in HLTV console
- Changed "status" output, more info displayed
- Fixed Linux system timer problem 
- Added cvar "maxloss", default 0.05, if packet loss exceeds this threshold, new spectators are rejected
- Zero delay possible for direct broadcasts without game buffering ("delay 0")
- Fixed MAX_OSPATH for Linux

Linux:
- Added "-pidfile <filename>" argument to hlds to get it to write the pid of the dedicated server process to the file specified. 
- Improved "-debug" command to look for core.<pid> files 
- hlds echoes to the controlling tty rather than stdout (solves 
redirecting output no longer showing key presses). 


v3.1.1.1c
--------
- Fixed format string crash bug in logging
- Fixed custom decals failing
- Fixed sound bug in demo playback
- Changed steam/valve string fromat from STEAM_x:y to STEAM_x:y:z

v3.1.1.1b
--------
- Fixed not being able to put hlds process in the background while redirecting
  console output
- Fixed halfd not working with the console
- Fixed not being able to kick bots
- Fixed game "pausing" until console input when using screen and similar programs
- Changed compiler versions and flags in an effort to increase performance
- Fixed potential security exploit in infobuffer

v3.1.1.1a
--------
- Fixed console not being able to go into the background
- Fixed crash bug when server was in a path with uppercase characters in it
- Fixed sv_stats failing on FreeBSD
- Made "kick # <id>" work again
- Increased max_queries_sec default to "3" 
- Increased max_queries_window to "60" 
    (this means any program can send 180 queries in a 60 second window, 
     hopefully the various tools can limit themselves to this) 
- Added "mapchangecfgfile" cvar. Set this to the filename of the file you want 
  run on map change.
- Created optimised binaries for AMD and i686 (Pentium II and above). 
   The "hlds_run" script auto-detects your CPU type and runs the corresponding
   binary. If detection fails then edit the top line of "hlds_run" to point to
   the correct binary for your CPU type.

HLTV:
- uses "valvecomm.lst" for authentication
- fixed "NULL" player names in HLTV demos
- new command "clearbanns" - removes all IPs from bann list
